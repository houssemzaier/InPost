## Project Overview

- In this project, I opted to leverage my current skills and the best practices as recommended by Google, specifically **Jetpack Compose**.
- I refactored the feature's fragment and illustrated how to architect the UI layer using **MVVM**, **LiveData**, **Compose**, and **Flow**.
- I ensured the immutability of streams and adopted a single `UIState` per screen and one model per Composable for robust data encapsulation.
- I chose a four-layered architecture for this project, namely the **Clean Architecture**. 
- My approach was to craft concise methods, ensuring they're unit-tested, especially when dealing with business logic.
- I also organized the modules and models by their respective responsibilities. 
- For module management, I embraced the new **Feature Catalog** recommendation.
- Lastly, I refactored the tests and their dependencies into a separate module.
